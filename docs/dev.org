mqtt proxy

The caller subscribes to a channel.

mqtt proxy is responsible for:

add the Client to the Subscriptions map

register a listener for incoming traffic
return the Client to the caller, so that he may unsubscribe at any point in time.

A Subscription instance is responsible for holding:

1. listeners that should be invoked when a message is received.
2. publish actions that are to be executed when the subscription is online
